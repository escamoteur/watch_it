/// WatchIt exports the default instance of get_it as a global variable which lets
/// you access it from anywhere in your app. To access any get_it registered
/// object you only have to type `di<MyType>()` instead of `GetIt.I<MyType>()`.
/// if you don't want to use a different instance of get_it you can pass it to
/// the functions of this library as an optional parameter
final di = GetIt.I;

/// The Watch functions:
///
/// The watch functions are the core of this library. They allow you to observe
/// any Listenable, Stream or Future and trigger a rebuild of your widget whenever
/// the watched object changes.
///
/// `ChangeNotifier` based example:
/// ```dart
/// // Create a ChangeNotifier based model
/// class UserModel extends ChangeNotifier {
///   get name = _name;
///   String _name = '';
///   set name(String value){
///     _name = value;
///     notifyListeners();
///   }
///   ...
/// }
///
/// // Register it
/// di.registerSingleton<UserModel>(UserModel());
///
/// // Watch it
/// class UserNameText extends WatchingWidget {
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     final userName = watchPropertyValue((UserModel m) => m.name);
///     return Text(userName);
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// there are the following functions:
///
/// * [watch] - observes any Listenable you have access to
/// * [watchIt] - observes any Listenable registered in get_it
/// * [watchValue] - observes a ValueListenable property of an object registered in get_it
/// * [watchPropertyValue] - observes a property of a Listenable object and trigger a rebuild
///   whenever the Listenable notifies a change and the value of the property changes
/// * [watchStream] - observes a Stream and triggers a rebuild whenever the Stream emits
///   a new value
/// * [watchFuture] - observes a Future and triggers a rebuild whenever the Future completes
///
/// To be able to use the functions you have either to derive your widget from
/// [WatchingWidget] or [WatchingStatefulWidget] or use the [WatchItMixin] in your
/// widget class.
///
/// To use the watch functions you have to call them inside the build function of
/// a [WatchingWidget] or [WatchingStatefulWidget] or a class that uses the
/// [WatchItMixin]. They basically allow you to avoid having to clutter your
/// widget tree with `ValueListenableBuilder`, `StreamBuilder` or `FutureBuilder`
/// widgets. Making your code more readable and maintainable.

/// The functions in detail:

/// [watch] observes any Listenable and triggers a rebuild whenever it notifies
/// a change. That listenable could be passed in as a parameter or be accessed via
/// get_it. Like `final userName = watch(di<UserManager>()).userName;` if UserManager is
/// a Listenable (eg. ChangeNotifier).
/// if any of the following functions don't fit your needs you can probably use
/// this one by manually providing the Listenable that should be observed.
